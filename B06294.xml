            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Element of <hi>Water</hi> is not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to any other of the Elements, neither is Nature wanting to work won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:175087:3"/> thereby; there is Å¿o great Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ity of Water, that without it no <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> can live, nor any <hi>Herb</hi> or <hi>Plant</hi> bring forth; for in it is the Seminary Vertue of all things, eÅ¿pecially of <hi>Animals,</hi> whoÅ¿e Seed is manifeÅ¿tly WatriÅ¿h. The Seeds alÅ¿o of all <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Plants,</hi> although they are Earthy, muÅ¿t notwithÅ¿tanding be rooted in moiÅ¿ture before they can be fruitful. The great and illuminated Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> tells us, that before the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the Earth was without Form, the Spirit of the Lord moved on the Face of the Waters; and in another place, that the <hi>Plants</hi> did not grow, becauÅ¿e God had not cauÅ¿ed it to Rain upon the Earth. Nay, Å¿o great is the Efficacy of this cleanÅ¿ing Element, that the Å¿piritual Regeneration cannot be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, as our Saviour ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tified to <hi>Nicomedus;</hi> and very great have the Vertues of it been in Religious WorÅ¿hip in former Ages, among the Prophets and WiÅ¿e Men in Expiations and Purifications. Innumerable are the Benefits, and Å¿o various the UÅ¿es thereof, both in the Generation, NouriÅ¿hment and IncreaÅ¿e of things, that Å¿ome of the WiÅ¿e Men have concluded, that <hi>Water</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:175087:3"/> was the beginning of all things, and firÅ¿t of all Elements, and the moÅ¿t Potent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e it hath the maÅ¿tery over all the reÅ¿t, for it Å¿walloweth up the Earth, extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiÅ¿hes Flames, aÅ¿cends on high, and by a moÅ¿t wonderful Divine Hand, and the Å¿tretching forth of the Clouds, challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Heavens for its Throne, whence falling down in gentle Showers and refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hing Dews, as from Natures choiceÅ¿t Limbeck, impregnated with CoeleÅ¿tial Vertues, it becomes the cauÅ¿e of all things that grow in the Earth.</p>
            <p>Nor is there Å¿carce any part of Nature more full of Wonders than theÅ¿e liquid Regions. <hi>JoÅ¿ephus</hi> tells us of a River near <hi>Sina,</hi> which runneth with a full Channel all the <hi>Sabbath-Day,</hi> and then on a Å¿udden it ceaÅ¿eth, as if the Spring were Å¿topped, and all the Å¿ix days you may paÅ¿s over it dry-Å¿hod; but again on the Å¿eventh-day (no Man knowing the reaÅ¿on of it) the Waters return in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance as before; wherefore the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereabouts call it the <hi>Sabbath days River.</hi> The GoÅ¿pel teÅ¿tifies of a <hi>Sheep-Pool,</hi> into which whoÅ¿oever Å¿topped firÅ¿t, after the Waters were troubled by the Angel, was made whole of whatÅ¿oever DiÅ¿eaÅ¿e he had.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:175087:4"/>
            <p>Many Å¿ecret and admirable Vertues the Creator hath endued this Element with, as in all Ages hath been manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ted; for it being pure and clear in its own Nature, it is the only and alone thing by which all external things are purified, purged and cleanÅ¿ed: But if it be adulterated or incorporated with any other Liquor or Juice, then it becomes leÅ¿s pure, and will not Å¿o well perform its Office, yet it may make them better and more uÅ¿eful. Though it be a vulgar Proverbâ<hi>As weak as Water:</hi> Yet I muÅ¿t tell you, <hi>Water</hi> is more Å¿trong and Å¿ublime that moÅ¿t imagine, for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a moÅ¿t raviÅ¿hing and excellent <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous BalÅ¿amick Vertue,</hi> whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds that pure Å¿weet refreÅ¿hing Quality, whereby it hath Power by its innate Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to digeÅ¿t and purifie all Å¿orts of Food: AlÅ¿o, in all Preparations it is Å¿o Innocent and Friendly that it diÅ¿Å¿ipates the groÅ¿s phlegmy Bodies, and preÅ¿erves the more eÅ¿Å¿ential Parts and Vertues, and keeps the <hi>Spirituous Parts</hi> living.</p>
            <p>It is not only the moÅ¿t plentiful and truly pleaÅ¿ant of all Drinks, but it Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies Nature with its friendly MoiÅ¿ture, and relieves ThirÅ¿t beyond all other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:175087:4"/> or Juices: It is Å¿o Simple, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with Å¿uch Equality, that it inÅ¿inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates its Vertue into all parts of the Body in an inÅ¿enÅ¿ible way; it makes no NoiÅ¿e, nor cauÅ¿es any Tumults in the Brain, nor awakens any Inequality in the Body, but imparts its meek Life as it were in Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Bread</hi> hath the firÅ¿t place of all Food, and may juÅ¿tly be called <hi>Concord,</hi> or a thing which God and his Handmaid Nature, hath befriended with all the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted good Vertues both of the <hi>Vegetable</hi> and <hi>Animal</hi> Kingdoms, and therefore no Å¿ort of Food is comparable thereunto, nor will gratifie Nature to the degree as it ought, without the help and mixture of Bread; though yet it is not the Å¿trongeÅ¿t of all Foods, nor hath the greateÅ¿t Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿hment, but it is the moÅ¿t equal in its parts, and Å¿tands neareÅ¿t the Unity, for which cauÅ¿e it is Å¿o much deÅ¿ired, and juÅ¿tly eÅ¿teemed the <hi>Staff of Life;</hi> and we are taught to Pray for all outward Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations needful for our Bodies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Å¿ignificant denomination of <hi>Our daily Bread,</hi> it being, beÅ¿ides its own nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive faculty, a proper Ingredient to qualifie the Inequality ofmoÅ¿t other Å¿orts
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:175087:5"/> of Food, and is the Foundation to all good NouriÅ¿hment: The like is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tood of <hi>Water,</hi> that being the <hi>Radix</hi> of all moiÅ¿t NouriÅ¿hment, which mixt or incorporated with any kind of Juices, renders them fit and profitable for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>Nay, (if we may fly our Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to an higher pitch) there is a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetical agreement, or Å¿ome Analogy between this External Water and that <hi>Internal,</hi> of which our Saviour ChriÅ¿t told the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that if Å¿he did drink, Å¿he Å¿hould never thirÅ¿t: This Internal Super-eÅ¿Å¿ential Water Å¿uÅ¿taineth every Being, and is the Radix and Life of the <hi>outward Water,</hi> which contains Å¿ome Shadows of the Å¿ecret Influences of the Water Internal; for which reaÅ¿on the Prophets and good Men of old have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently compared the one with the other, and expreÅ¿Å¿ed the one by the other, and alÅ¿o have made uÅ¿e of <hi>Water</hi> in Religious MyÅ¿teries as a Å¿ign of CleanÅ¿ing and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying the Soul from Sins, and for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring DiÅ¿eaÅ¿es, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Scriptures<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> do teÅ¿tifie.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought fit to Å¿ay of <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in general, to Å¿tir up men to praiÅ¿e
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:175087:5"/> and admire the GoodneÅ¿s and WiÅ¿dom of the <hi>All Creator,</hi> for the manifold UÅ¿es, Vertues and Benefits wherewith he hath endued this Element. But now let us conÅ¿ider the Å¿everal Å¿orts of <hi>Water.</hi>
